# Son
A scenario-based programming language

**Son** is an experimental programming language designed as a subset of JavaScript. It simplifies programming by eliminating complex constructs like branching and loops, allowing only linear algorithms. In Son, each procedure is represented as a set of *scenarios*, which are individual units of logic. The languageâ€™s transpiler automatically combines these scenarios to build the full procedure.

One key advantage of Son is that scenarios are easy to test in isolation, making debugging and verification straightforward. Additionally, anyone with basic JavaScript knowledge can quickly start using Son, thanks to its familiar syntax and streamlined approach.
